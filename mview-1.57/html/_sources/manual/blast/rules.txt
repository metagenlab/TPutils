BLAST HSP processing rules
==========================

A BLAST run comprises, among other sections, a 'ranking' of hits with one-line
summaries including scoring information, followed by the search database
'hits' themselves. Each hit may contain one or more HSPs (ungapped BLAST) or
gapped alignments (gapped BLAST), not all of which may be reported in the
ranking.

Some control over which HSPs are to be processed by MView is provided by the
command line option ``-hsp``. There are three choices: 

 ================= ============================================================
 MView option      Description
 ================= ============================================================
 ``-hsp ranked``   Only those HSPs or alignments that contributed to the
                   ranked hit are selected. These are tiled into a single
		   alignment row per hit. This is the default behaviour.

 ``-hsp all``      All HSPs or alignments are selected and tiled into a single
                   alignment row per hit.

 ``-hsp discrete`` All HSPs or alignments are selected but each is assigned
                   its own row in the resulting stacked alignment.
 ================= ============================================================

Precise application of these processing modes varies slightly with each BLAST
program because properties such as query and/or hit nucleotide strand
orientation or reading frame must be taken into consideration

A more detailed description of the selection rules is given for each BLAST
family and program, as follows:

.. toctree::

   blast1
   blast2


Differences between NCBI BLAST 1 and NCBI BLAST 2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* In the default gapped mode, the BLAST 2 programs produce no *N* fragment
  counts. Fragment counts are switched on in BLAST when it is run in ungapped
  mode using the ``blastall... -g F`` command line option.

* Significances are reported only as Expectation (e-values), *E* rather than
  p-values, *P*.

* BLASTN: negative orientation query strands are not reported because the
  query and hit can always be reverse complemented to revert the query back to
  the positive strand orientation.

* BLASTX: query strands don't carry frame information (early versions only).

* TBLASTN: hit strands don't carry frame information (early versions only).

* TBLASTX: query and hit strands don't carry frame information (early versions
  only).

With BLAST 2 series output, MView assumes that only one fragment (a gapped
alignment) is required in 'ranked' mode and accepts the FIRST alignment with
score and expectation matching those in the hit ranking. If you wish to see
the effect of any other HSPs use the ``-hsp all`` or ``-hsp discrete`` options
to MView. This is particularly important if you use BLAST in ungapped mode.

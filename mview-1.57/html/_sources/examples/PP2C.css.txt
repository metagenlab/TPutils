Blocked letters
===============

A hand finished CLUSTAL alignment using built-in colour palettes and
consensus pattern residue equivalence classes: member residues of the 80%
consensus class for each column are coloured according to their own property.

The ``-css on`` option produces the blocked letter effect.

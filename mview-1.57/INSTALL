Installation

1. Save the archive to your software area, e.g., '/usr/local', then uncompress
   and extract it using of these methods, depending on which archive format you
   downloaded.
 
   For the bzipped archive, one of::

     tar xvjf mview-1.57.tar.bz2

     bunzip2 < mview-1.57.tar.bz2 | tar xvf -

   For the gzipped archive, one of::

     tar xvzf mview-1.57.tar.gz

     gunzip < mview-1.57.tar.gz | tar xvf -

   This would create a directory called mview-1.57 and place all the
   files under there.

2. Change to this directory and load bin/mview into an editor.

3. Set a Perl interpreter path valid for your machine after the #!.

4. Change the "use lib 'path/to/my/lib';" line to, in our example, 

     use lib '/usr/local/mview-1.57/lib';

5. Finally, add mview to somewhere on your PATH and rehash or login again.

Ask your system manager or a Perl guru for help if this looks weird.
